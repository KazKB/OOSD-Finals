# OOSD-Finals
Done in Intellij. It is a basic point of sale terminal where one can track purchases from suppliers and the suppliers themselves, sales to customers and customers themselves as well as the stock. It is for a drinks (non-alcoholic and alcoholic) seller. Thus beers, champagnes, juices, sodas, spirit, waters and wines can be tracked. Further improvements can be made.

Upon start one has to either login in or sign-up.

Then after that, the whole system is free to access. However, certain features are admin only. 

Admin only features include:
- Adding stock
- Removing stock
- Editing stock prices
- Adding suppliers
- Removing suppliers
- Editing suppliers information
- Edit supplier purchase list
- Editing what can be bought from suppliers
- Buy from suppliers
- Refunding customers

To use the system is easy:
- One has to enter the stock they have.
- Then they enter the suppliers and what can be bought from them, should be the same name as what was enter in stock (doesn't have to be what the supplies call it, but what you are selling and know it as).
As one buys from suppliers the quantity in stock will change, and the wallet will reflect the purchases.
- Then one can add customers and sell to them.
As one sells to customers, quantity in stock will change, and the wallet will reflect the sales.

It is a simple system that only uses one file for the loggings. No database yet.
